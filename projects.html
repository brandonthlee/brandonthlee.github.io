							<h3>BudgetBunny</h3>
							<p>During my application to nwHacks 2019, I was pretty stumped on what to answer for the question on what I was planning on building here.
								After some thinking, I realized that I have not been managing my finances so wisely, especially now that I moved away to university and there was no one watching over how I spend my money.
								BudgetBunny was the solution; a budgetting app that allows you take pictures of your receipts every time you bought something.</p>
							<p>For starters, setting up Android Studio was challenging at the beginning, due to issues with Gradle not recognizing the build properly.
								Furthermore, I had to spend a lot of time reading documentation and troubleshooting the Google Mobile Vision API because it was reading the text sideways.
								This project did come with a lot of issues and quick workarounds had to be implemented to fix them;
								however, I think all of this was definitely an invaluable experience as I was able to create my first mobile application and learn the fundamentals of each component of an app, from front-end to back-end.</p>

							<h3>PlayerManager</h3>
							<p>For my software construction course at UBC, I was required to complete a project of my own design.
								With my interest in soccer, I decided to create an app with functionalities similar to soccer manangement simulation video games I had played before.
								Since building this project was a way of learning Java from the bottom-up, grasping the very concept of object-oriented programming was one of the hardest challenges I encountered.
								As such, I had to spend a lot of time understanding OOP concepts such as abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.
